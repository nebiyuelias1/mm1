# mm1
C program for the M/M/1 queue simulation. We use the
ANSI-standard version of the language, as defined by Kernighan and Ritchie (1988),
and in particular use function prototyping. We have also taken advantage of Câ€™s
facility to give variables and functions fairly long names, which thus should be self-
explanatory. (For instance, the current value of simulated time is in a variable called
sim_time.)

In order to run the mm1.c program use the following command to compile with GCC:
```
gcc lcgrand.c mm1.c -o mm1 -lm
```
Then you should be able to run the executable using:
```
./mm1
```
